# Let us make the best rice the world could imagine! #
**_In order to have a successful subversion experience please follow the following rules._**
# DUCK #
> ## Don't Commit Broken Code ##
    * Think hard about whether you are ready to commit, if it's broken don't commit it.
    * If it can't compile, really don't commit it.
> ## Update ##
    * Update before committing to avoid having more problems while committing
    * This will also allow you to settle all conflicts that will come from having edited the same file
> ## Commit ##
    * After you've done the previous steps, you may now move on to committing your changes, click that commit button now
> ## Kreate a commit log message ##
    * Now that you've committed the change, you need to make a log message so that people know what you've updated and so that in the frightening event that our code is broken we can know which revision to revert to before continuing.
